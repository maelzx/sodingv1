### But Github Pages done created and edited by 12:42PM

## HOW TO RUN THIS ?

- Clone or Download the sourcode: https://github.com/maelzx/sodingv1.git (or download [ZIP FILE](https://github.com/maelzx/sodingv1/archive/master.zip))
- Copy/Extract into your configured web server directory (eg: C:\xampp\htdcos\...)
- Or (my preferred way) if you have your PHP accessible/runnable from command line, just go to the directory/folder that you save the source code files and run this:
```
php -S localhost:8000
```
- Then put this address into your browser:
```
http://localhost:8000
```
- You're done!
